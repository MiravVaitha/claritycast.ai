## Architecture Notes

- Global animated background mounted once in layout (fixed, non-blocking)
- Server-side Gemini calls for secure API usage
- Retry + timeout handling for production stability
- Structured JSON generation with safe parsing
- Graceful fallback for demo resilience
- Stateless design (no database required for demo version)

---

## Deployment

This project is deployed using **Vercel**.

Production builds are automatically deployed on every push to the `main` branch.

---

## 🚀 Roadmap

ClarityCast is actively evolving. Upcoming improvements include:

- Character-driven AI interaction (Think with Bear / Speak with Parrot)
- Reduced user friction in communication controls
- Enhanced structured output reliability
- Performance optimizations

Feedback and iteration are ongoing.
